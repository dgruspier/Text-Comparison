# Text-Comparison
This is a final project completed for the course CS 111: Introduction to Programming (in Python) at Boston University.
The program allows the user to submit a bank of large pieces of texts (e.g. articles, books) in plain text.
It then can consider a single piece of text and determine who the author of the text is based on the repository clearly submitted.
It achieves this by considering varies defining characteristics of text such as sentence length, word choice, and paragraph length.

For example, the user may submit to the program three articles each from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
The program reads the articles and analyzes them to gain an understanding of the writing styles of these two publications.
The user may then submit, say, a fourth New York Times article and ask the program to determine the publication.
The intent is that the program is able to answer correctly that the article is from the New York Times.

Please note that this project was completed in collaboration with one other student as allowed by the constraints of the assignment.
